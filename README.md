# Louisville_Seedbank_Project
The goal of my project is to be able to imput the name of one of the top 20 seeds that the Louisville Seedbank distributes

Value one: Harvest Season, Value two: Days to Maturity, Value three: Sun requirements

Modules
#pip install pandas
#pip install numpy
#pip install seaborn (Not sure if I need this)

1. Make a list, dictionary, tuple, or other standard python data structure to read in data for your program. You can do something as easy as a dictionary that contains 5 key value pairs with information about 
2. Read in data from a local csv, excel file, json, or any other file type. There are many ways to do this, but using Pandas read_ functions is pretty easy.
